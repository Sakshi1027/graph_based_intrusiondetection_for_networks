# Graph-Based Intrusion Detection System

## Overview

This project implements a **Graph-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using network traffic data to detect malicious activities. The system processes network flow data, constructs graph representations, and visualizes network interactions using a web-based interface built with **Gradio** and **D3.js**.

The dataset used is the **CICIDS2017 Wednesday-workingHours** dataset, which contains both benign and malicious network flows (e.g., DoS Hulk, DoS GoldenEye, DoS Slowloris, DoS Slowhttptest, and Heartbleed attacks).

The project includes:
- Data preprocessing  
- Graph construction  
- A user interface for visualizing network graphs and predicting malicious patterns  
- A comparison between traditional and incremental graph-based approaches for intrusion detection (with differences in computational complexity and memory usage)

---

## üîç Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loads and processes the CICIDS2017 dataset using Pandas, handling missing values and converting timestamps.
- **Graph Construction**: Creates time-based graph snapshots from network flows, representing IPs as nodes and connections as edges.
- **Visualization**: Provides a web interface using D3.js to visualize traditional and incremental graphs and highlight malicious activity.
- **Metrics Display**: Shows computational complexity, memory usage, and detection latency.
- **Prediction Interface**: Users can upload node and edge CSV files or use a default dataset to predict malicious patterns.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Gradio, including tabs for live graph visualization, metrics, and file upload.

## üìÅ Dataset

The project uses the `Wednesday-workingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv` from the **CICIDS2017** dataset, which contains **692,703** network flow records with **85** features.

### Key Features Used:
- `Flow ID`, `Source IP`, `Destination IP`, `Source Port`, `Destination Port`, `Protocol`, `Timestamp`: Used for graph construction.
- `Label`: Indicates whether the flow is benign or one of several DoS attacks or Heartbleed.

The dataset is preprocessed to select relevant features and convert timestamps to datetime objects for temporal graph analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas gradio numpy d3
```

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Google Colab (optional for running in the cloud)
- Access to the CICIDS2017 dataset
- D3.js (loaded via CDN in Gradio interface)

---

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-based-intrusion-detection.git
cd graph-based-intrusion-detection
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Place the dataset:**

Put the dataset (`Wednesday-workingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv`) into the appropriate path, e.g.:

```
/content/drive/MyDrive/ids/daa/dataset/
```

4. **Run the notebook:**

```bash
jupyter notebook "daa (2).ipynb"
```

---

##  Usage

### üìò Run the Notebook:

- Open `daa (2).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Run the cells in order to:
  - Load and preprocess the dataset.
  - Launch the interactive Gradio interface.

### üåê Gradio Interface:

- **Tab 1: Live Graph Visualization**
  - Real-time traditional and incremental graph updates.
  - Display of metrics: complexity, memory usage, and latency.

- **Tab 2: Model Metrics**
  - Static plots for graph size, latency, detection accuracy, and malicious pattern detection.
  - Note: Plots are currently placeholders and should be replaced with actual metric visualizations.

- **Tab 3: Graph Input & Prediction**
  - Upload your own node and edge CSV files.
  - Or use the default dataset for predictions.

###  Interact:

- Click **"Start Simulation"** to begin real-time graph visualization.
- Use **"Upload"** in the prediction tab to test with your custom graph files.
- Monitor the metric tabs to compare traditional vs. incremental detection models.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **Dataset Path**: Update the dataset path in the notebook (`/content/drive/MyDrive/ids/daa/dataset/`) to match your environment.
- **Prediction Function**: The `predict_graph` function in the Gradio UI is partially implemented. You may need to define this function to complete the prediction capability.
- **Graphs**: Replace placeholder images (`graph.png`, `graph1.png`, etc.) with actual plots from your metric evaluations.
- **Gradio on Colab**: If you're using Colab, the Gradio app will run on a public URL. Ensure internet access and appropriate sharing settings.
